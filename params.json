With the speed of C, simplicity of PHP and the structure of a framework, Phalcon streamlines web application development.\r\n\r\nGetting Started with PHP is an introduction to using Phalcon to develop web applications. You will learn by building a blog application using Phalcon developer tools and web tools to flesh out the CRUD skeleton for an application quickly and then modify it to add features.\r\n\r\nAs features are added to the blog, you will learn to use other Phalcon functionality like the Volt template engine, view helpers, PHQL, validation, encryption, cookies, sessions, etc.\r\n\r\nBy Stephan Miller\r\n\r\n#Chapter Code Releases\r\n\r\nI have created the following tags for the code for each chapter, as the application progresses.\r\n\r\n* [All Tags](https://github.com/eristoddle/phalconBlog/releases)\r\n* [Chapter 2](https://github.com/eristoddle/phalconBlog/releases/tag/chapter2)\r\n* [Chapter 3](https://github.com/eristoddle/phalconBlog/releases/tag/chapter3)\r\n* [Chapter 4](https://github.com/eristoddle/phalconBlog/releases/tag/chapter4)\r\n* [Final](https://github.com/eristoddle/phalconBlog)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
